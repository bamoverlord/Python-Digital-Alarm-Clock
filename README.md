# Python-Digital-Alarm-Clock
This is a digital alarm clock in Python made using PyQt5 modules.

With inspiration from BroCode's Python Tutorial. I have decided to import the code to show others my creation to other people that may want to create the same project.

One file that is not used in python is needed to download in order to get the full digitical clock experience.
